Two platforms were used to test the hypothesis that a more visual EHR interface would lead to quicker more accurate chart reviews. These two platforms were [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com) and [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com)."

In each of the referenced notebooks above, each question will be compared between the two arms in several meaningful ways:\n",
