Also, whether a prescription was filled is more important and relevant during scrolling then the doctor who prescribed certain meds.

I first tried to do the survey on my ipad, and the tutorial instructed me on how to use the EMR in a color-coded horizontal layout, which seemed intuitive and easy to use.  The only problem was that on my ipad, the layout cut off either ends of the screen, so that I couldn't see or answer the clinical questions on the left.  Then, when I logged in to my computer to complete the survey, the EMR was in a completely different layout.  Everything was essentially the same color and vertical.  After seeing the previous format, I had a strong dislike of the one I eventually had to use to answer the clinical questions.  It greatly increased my frustration and I ended the exercise feeling downright angry.",35.889602661133,-78.92440032959,-1,
